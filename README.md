# Alaria's Dotfiles

These are my standard loadout of dotfiles for servers.
They're fairly basic sense this repo primarily serves as a
way to very quickly load some basic dotfiles onto
a server rather than a way to share my bewautiful riced desktop.

## k5p-a3_MacOS

These are the dotfiles for my Keychron K5Pro (model k5p-a3).

### Installation instructions

1. Connect keyboard via cable and set it to "wired" connection
2. Open via.app
3. Go to _Design_ tab and import `k5p-a3/layout.json` as the keyboard layout
4. Go to the _Keymap_ tab and import `k5p-a3/keymap.json` as the "layout"
5. Wait a second for the keyboard to update, then test the wierd keys
